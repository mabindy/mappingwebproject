# Services Ran by Web Servers

## About

Web servers are powerful computers that deliver web pages to your browser. They handle requests from users, run scripts, manage databases, and serve media files. Web servers are essential for the functioning of the internet, enabling websites and applications to operate smoothly.

## Real World Examples

### Cloud Storage
Services like Google Drive and Dropbox use web servers to store and manage your files. When you upload a file, it is sent to a web server, which saves it and makes it accessible from any device with an internet connection.

### Streaming Media
Platforms like Netflix and YouTube use web servers to stream videos. When you watch a video, the web server sends the video data to your device in small chunks, allowing you to watch without downloading the entire file.

### E-commerce
Online stores like Amazon use web servers to manage product listings, process orders, and handle payments. When you make a purchase, the web server processes your payment information and updates the inventory.

## How Web Servers Work

### Running Scripts
Web servers can run scripts written in languages like PHP, Python, or JavaScript. These scripts generate dynamic content, such as user profiles or search results, based on user input.

### Serverless Architectures
In a serverless architecture, the cloud provider manages the server infrastructure. Developers write functions that run in response to events, such as a user uploading a file. This approach simplifies development and reduces costs.

### Cloud Computing
Cloud computing allows businesses to rent computing resources from providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Microsoft Azure. Web servers in the cloud can scale up or down based on demand, ensuring reliable performance.

### Databases
Web servers often interact with databases to store and retrieve data. For example, a social media site might use a database to store user profiles and posts. The web server queries the database to display this information to users.

### Media
Web servers can serve images, videos, and other media files. Content delivery networks (CDNs) distribute these files across multiple servers worldwide, reducing load times and improving performance.

## Browser and Web Server Interaction

When you visit a website, your browser sends a request to the web server. The server processes the request, runs any necessary scripts, and sends the response back to your browser. This process happens quickly, allowing you to browse the web seamlessly.

## Internet Problems

Slow internet speeds can affect cloud-based services by causing delays in loading pages or buffering videos. High latency can also impact real-time applications like video calls or online gaming.

## Security Protocols

Protocols like HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and HTTPS (HTTP Secure) ensure secure communication between your browser and the web server. HTTPS encrypts data, protecting sensitive information like passwords and credit card numbers from being intercepted.

## IoT Devices

Internet of Things (IoT) devices use web servers to send and receive real-time data. For example, a smart thermostat might send temperature data to a web server, which processes the information and adjusts the heating system accordingly.
